 1. The code is voilating the SRP.
 2. GOD anti-pattern is in place.
 
 Suggestions/Improvisations:
 1. The features of battery health check up can be distributed to different methods.
    Each method returning the boolean - characteristic of that particular feature
    The main method can return the final status - combination of the output from different methods.
